Summary

What are migraines?
Migraines are a recurring type of headache. They cause moderate to severe pain that is throbbing or pulsing. The pain is often on one side of your head. You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea and weakness. You may be sensitive to light and sound.
What causes migraines?
Researchers believe that migraine has a genetic cause. There are also a number of factors that can trigger a migraine. These factors vary from person to person, and they include:
Stress
Anxiety
Hormonal changes in women
Bright or flashing lights
Loud noises
Strong smells
Medicines
Too much or not enough sleep
Sudden changes in weather or environment
Overexertion (too much physical activity)
Tobacco
Caffeine or caffeine withdrawal
Skipped meals
Medication overuse (taking medicine for migraines too often)

Some people have found that certain foods or ingredients can trigger headaches, especially when they are combined with other triggers. These foods and ingredients include:
Alcohol
Chocolate
Aged cheeses
Monosodium glutamate (MSG)
Some fruits and nuts
Fermented or pickled goods
Yeast
Cured or processed meats

Who is at risk for migraines?
About 12% of Americans get migraines. They can affect anyone, but you are more likely to have them if you:
Are a woman. Women are three times more likely than men to get migraines.
Have a family history of migraines. Most people with migraines have family members who have migraines.
Have other medical conditions, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, sleep disorders, and epilepsy.

What are the symptoms of migraines?
There are four different phases of migraines. You may not always go through every phase each time you have a migraine.:
Prodome. This phase starts up to 24 hours before you get the migraine. You have early signs and symptoms, such as food cravings, unexplained mood changes, uncontrollable yawning, fluid retention, and increased urination.
Aura. If you have this phase, you might see flashing or bright lights or zig-zag lines. You may have muscle weakness or feel like you are being touched or grabbed. An aura can happen just before or during a migraine.
Headache. A migraine usually starts gradually and then becomes more severe. It typically causes throbbing or pulsing pain, which is often on one side of your head. But sometimes you can have a migraine without a headache. Other migraine symptoms may include

Increased sensitivity to light, noise, and odors
Nausea and vomiting
Worsened pain when you move, cough, or sneeze

Postdrome (following the headache). You may feel exhausted, weak, and confused after a migraine. This can last up to a day.

Migraines are more common in the morning; people often wake up with them. Some people have migraines at predictable times, such as before menstruation or on weekends following a stressful week of work.
How are migraines diagnosed?
To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will:
Take your medical history
Ask about your symptoms
Do a physical and neurological exam

An important part of diagnosing migraines is to rule out other medical conditions which could be causing the symptoms. So you may also have blood tests, an MRI or CT scan, or other tests.
How are migraines treated?
There is no cure for migraines. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks.
There are different types of medicines to relieve symptoms. They include triptan drugs, ergotamine drugs, and pain relievers. The sooner you take the medicine, the more effective it is.
There are also other things you can do to feel better:
Resting with your eyes closed in a quiet, darkened room
Placing a cool cloth or ice pack on your forehead
Drinking fluids

There are some lifestyle changes you can make to prevent migraines:
Stress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and biofeedback, may reduce the number and severity of migraines. Biofeedback uses electronic devices to teach you to control certain body functions, such as your heartbeat, blood pressure, and muscle tension.
Make a log of what seems to trigger your migraines. You can learn what you need to avoid, such as certain foods and medicines. It also help you figure out what you should do, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and eating regular meals.
Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle
If you have obesity, losing weight may also be helpful

If you have frequent or severe migraines, you may need to take medicines to prevent further attacks. Talk with your health care provider about which drug would be right for you.
Certain natural treatments, such as riboflavin (vitamin B2) and coenzyme Q10, may help prevent migraines. If your magnesium level is low, you can try taking magnesium. There is also an herb, butterbur, which some people take to prevent migraines. But butterbur may not be safe for long-term use. Always check with your health care provider before taking any supplements.

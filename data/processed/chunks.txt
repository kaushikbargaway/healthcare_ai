What is asthma? Asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease. It affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed. This can cause wheezing, coughing, and tightness in your chest. When these symptoms get worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack or flare-up. What causes asthma?
What causes asthma? The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and your environment likely play a role in who gets asthma. An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:
Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include 	 Dust mites Mold Pets Pollen from grass, trees, and weeds Waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice
Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as 	 Breathing in cold air Certain medicines Household chemicals Infections such as colds and the flu Outdoor air pollution Tobacco smoke   Occupational asthma is caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at work Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry
Asthma triggers may be different for each person and can change over time. Who is at risk for asthma? Asthma affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood. Certain factors can raise your risk of having asthma: Being exposed to secondhand smoke when your mother is pregnant with you or when you are a small child
Being exposed to certain substances at work, such as chemical irritants or industrial dusts Genetics and family history. You are more likely to have asthma if one of your parents has it, especially if it's your mother. Race or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities.
Having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergies Often having viral respiratory infections as a young child Sex. In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens and adults, it is more common in women.
What are the symptoms of asthma? The symptoms of asthma include: Chest tightness Coughing, especially at night or early morning Shortness of breath Wheezing, which causes a whistling sound when you breathe out
These symptoms can range from mild to severe. You may have them every day or only once in a while. When you are having an asthma attack, your symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. They are more common in people who have severe asthma. If you are having asthma attacks, you may need a change in your treatment.
How is asthma diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma: Physical exam Medical history Lung function tests, including spirometry, to test how well your lungs work
Tests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed. Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.
What are the treatments for asthma? If you have asthma, you will work with your health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. It will include: Strategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for you, you should not smoke or allow other people to smoke in your home or car.
Short-term relief medicines,  also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to carry with you all the time. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways.
Control medicines.  You take them every day to help prevent symptoms. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways.
If you have a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, you will need emergency care. Your provider may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled.
Sometimes asthma is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments. If you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so
more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider.

Coughing is a reflex that keeps your throat and airways clear.  Although it can be annoying, coughing helps your body heal or protect itself. Coughs can be either acute or chronic.  Acute coughs begin suddenly and usually last no more than 2 to 3 weeks.  Acute coughs are the kind you most often get with a cold, flu, or acute bronchitis.  Chronic coughs last longer than 2 to 3 weeks.  Causes of
coughs last longer than 2 to 3 weeks.  Causes of chronic cough include:
Chronic bronchitis Asthma Allergies COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)  Smoking Throat disorders, such as croup in young children Some medicines
Water can help ease your cough - whether you drink it or add it to the air with a steamy shower or vaporizer. If you have a cold or the flu, antihistamines may work better than non-prescription cough medicines.   Children under four should not have cough medicine.  For children over four, use caution and read labels carefully.

What is diabetes? Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but it also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas. Insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy.
If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead to serious health conditions. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.
What are the types of diabetes? There are different types of diabetes:
Type 1 diabetes. If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin. It happens when your immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin.
Type 2 diabetes. This is the most common form of diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body may still be able to make insulin, but your cells don't respond well to insulin. They can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood. Gestational diabetes. This is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It happens when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs during pregnancy.
What causes diabetes? The different types of diabetes have different causes:
Researchers think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and factors in the environment that might trigger the disease. Type 2 diabetes is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes. The lifestyle factors include not being physically active and being overweight or having obesity.
Researchers think gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.
Who is more likely to develop diabetes? The different types of diabetes have different risk factors:  You can develop type 1 diabetes at any age, but it most often starts in childhood. Having a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes may increase your chance of developing it. You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:
Are overweight or have obesity. Are over age 35. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older adults. Have a family history of diabetes. Have prediabetes. This means that your blood glucose is higher than normal, but it's not high enough to be called diabetes. Had gestational diabetes.
Had gestational diabetes. Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more. Are African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander. Are not physically active. Have certain other health conditions, such as high blood pressure or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
You are at higher risk of developing gestational diabetes if you:  Are overweight or have obesity. Have a family history of diabetes. Had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy. Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more. Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Are African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander.
What are the symptoms of diabetes? The symptoms of diabetes may include:  Feeling very thirsty Feeling very hungry Urinating (peeing) more often, including at night Fatigue Blurry vision Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands Sores that do not heal Losing weight without trying  But it's important to know that your symptoms may vary, depending on which type you have:
The symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually come on quickly and can be severe. With type 2 diabetes, the symptoms often develop slowly, over several years. The symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them.
Gestational diabetes often has no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may be mild. If you are pregnant, you will usually be screened for this condition between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.
How is diabetes diagnosed? To find out if you have diabetes, your health care provider will use one or more glucose blood tests. There are several types, including the A1C test. What are the treatments for diabetes? Treatment for diabetes involves managing your blood glucose levels:
If you have type 1 diabetes, you will need to take daily doses of insulin, either by injection or through a special pump. Some people also need to take another type of diabetes medicine that works with insulin.
If you have type 2 diabetes, you may be able to manage or even reverse it by making lifestyle changes. These include eating a healthy diet, staying at healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity. Some people also need to take diabetes medicines to manage their diabetes.
If you have gestational diabetes, you may be able to lower your glucose levels by eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise. But be sure to talk to your provider about your treatment options. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after you give birth. But you will have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.
Checking your blood glucose levels is also an important part of managing your diabetes. Ask your provider about the best way to check your blood glucose level and how often you should check it. Can diabetes be prevented? Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented.
Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. You may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes through the same lifestyle changes that are used to manage diabetes (eating a healthy diet, staying at a healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity). These lifestyle changes may also help prevent gestational diabetes. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. A normal temperature can vary from person to person, but it is usually around 98.6 °F (37 °C). A fever is not a disease. It is usually a sign that your body is trying to fight an illness or infection.
Infections cause most fevers. You get a fever because your body is trying to kill the virus or bacteria that caused the infection. Most of those bacteria and viruses do well when your body is at your normal temperature. But if you have a fever, it is harder for them to survive. Fever also activates your body's immune system. Other causes of fevers include:
Other causes of fevers include: Medicines, including some antibiotics, blood pressure medicines, and anti-seizure medicines Heat illness Cancers Autoimmune diseases Some childhood vaccines
Treatment depends on the cause of your fever. If the fever is very high, your health care provider may recommend taking an over-the-counter medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Adults can also take aspirin, but children with fevers should not take aspirin. It is also important to drink enough liquids, to prevent dehydration.

What is the flu? The flu, also called influenza, is a respiratory infection caused by viruses. Each year, millions of Americans get sick with the flu. Sometimes it causes mild illness. But it can also be serious or even deadly, especially for people over 65, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses. What causes the flu?
What causes the flu? The flu is caused by flu viruses that spread from person to person. When someone with the flu coughs, sneezes, or talks, they spray tiny droplets. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person may get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.
What are the symptoms of the flu? Symptoms of the flu come on suddenly and may include: Fever or feeling feverish/chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue (tiredness)
Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea. This is more common in children. Sometimes people have trouble figuring out whether they have a cold or the flu. There are differences between them:    Signs and Symptoms Cold Flu     Start of symptoms Slowly Suddenly   Fever Rarely Usually   Aches Sometimes (slight) Usually   Fatigue, weakness Sometimes Usually   Headache Rarely Common
Headache Rarely Common   Stuffy nose, sneezing, or sore throat Common Sometimes
Sometimes people say that they have a "flu" when they really have something else. For example, "stomach flu" isn't the flu; it's gastroenteritis. What other problems can the flu cause? Some people who get the flu will develop complications. Some of these complications can be serious or even life-threatening. They include: Bronchitis Ear infection Sinus infection Pneumonia
Ear infection Sinus infection Pneumonia Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or muscle tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis)
The flu also can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may have asthma attacks while they have flu. Certain people are more likely to have complications from the flu, including: Adults 65 and older Pregnant women Children younger than 5 People with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease
How is the flu diagnosed? To diagnose the flu, health care providers will first do a medical history and ask about your symptoms. There are several tests for the flu. For the tests, your provider will swipe the inside of your nose or the back of your throat with a swab. Then the swab will be tested for the flu virus.
Some tests are quick and give results in 15-20 minutes. But these tests are not as accurate as other flu tests. These other tests can give you the results in one hour or several hours. What are the treatments for the flu? Most people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care.
But if you have symptoms of flu and are in a high risk group or are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need antiviral medicines to treat your flu. Antiviral medicines can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days of
best when you start taking them within 2 days of getting sick.
Can the flu be prevented? The best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine every year. But it's also important to have good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands often. This can help stop the spread of germs and prevent the flu. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Each year almost 800,000 Americans have a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Without the blood coming in, the heart can't get oxygen. If not treated quickly, the heart muscle begins to die. But if you do get quick treatment, you may be able to prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. That's why it's important to know the symptoms of a
why it's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 911 if you or someone else is having them. You should call, even if you are not sure that it is a heart attack.
The most common symptoms in men and women are: Chest discomfort. It is often in center or left side of the chest. It usually lasts more than a few minutes. It may go away and come back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.
Shortness of breath. Sometimes this is your only symptom. You may get it before or during the chest discomfort. It can happen when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. Discomfort in the upper body. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach.
You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and lightheadedness. You may break out in a cold sweat. Sometimes women will have different symptoms then men. For example, they are more likely to feel tired for no reason.
The most common cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD). With CAD, there is a buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls or the arteries. This is atherosclerosis. It can build up for years. Eventually an area of plaque can rupture (break open). A blood clot can form around the plaque and block the artery.
A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery.
At the hospital, health care providers make a diagnosis based on your symptoms, blood tests, and different heart health tests. Treatments may include medicines and medical procedures such as coronary angioplasty. After a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes can help you recover.

What are migraines? Migraines are a recurring type of headache. They cause moderate to severe pain that is throbbing or pulsing. The pain is often on one side of your head. You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea and weakness. You may be sensitive to light and sound. What causes migraines?
What causes migraines? Researchers believe that migraine has a genetic cause. There are also a number of factors that can trigger a migraine. These factors vary from person to person, and they include: Stress Anxiety Hormonal changes in women Bright or flashing lights Loud noises Strong smells Medicines Too much or not enough sleep Sudden changes in weather or environment
Sudden changes in weather or environment Overexertion (too much physical activity) Tobacco Caffeine or caffeine withdrawal Skipped meals Medication overuse (taking medicine for migraines too often)
Some people have found that certain foods or ingredients can trigger headaches, especially when they are combined with other triggers. These foods and ingredients include: Alcohol Chocolate Aged cheeses Monosodium glutamate (MSG) Some fruits and nuts Fermented or pickled goods Yeast Cured or processed meats
Who is at risk for migraines? About 12% of Americans get migraines. They can affect anyone, but you are more likely to have them if you: Are a woman. Women are three times more likely than men to get migraines. Have a family history of migraines. Most people with migraines have family members who have migraines.
Have other medical conditions, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, sleep disorders, and epilepsy.
What are the symptoms of migraines? There are four different phases of migraines. You may not always go through every phase each time you have a migraine.: Prodome. This phase starts up to 24 hours before you get the migraine. You have early signs and symptoms, such as food cravings, unexplained mood changes, uncontrollable yawning, fluid retention, and increased urination.
Aura. If you have this phase, you might see flashing or bright lights or zig-zag lines. You may have muscle weakness or feel like you are being touched or grabbed. An aura can happen just before or during a migraine.
Headache. A migraine usually starts gradually and then becomes more severe. It typically causes throbbing or pulsing pain, which is often on one side of your head. But sometimes you can have a migraine without a headache. Other migraine symptoms may include
Increased sensitivity to light, noise, and odors Nausea and vomiting Worsened pain when you move, cough, or sneeze  Postdrome (following the headache). You may feel exhausted, weak, and confused after a migraine. This can last up to a day.
Migraines are more common in the morning; people often wake up with them. Some people have migraines at predictable times, such as before menstruation or on weekends following a stressful week of work. How are migraines diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will: Take your medical history Ask about your symptoms Do a physical and neurological exam
An important part of diagnosing migraines is to rule out other medical conditions which could be causing the symptoms. So you may also have blood tests, an MRI or CT scan, or other tests. How are migraines treated? There is no cure for migraines. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks.
There are different types of medicines to relieve symptoms. They include triptan drugs, ergotamine drugs, and pain relievers. The sooner you take the medicine, the more effective it is. There are also other things you can do to feel better: Resting with your eyes closed in a quiet, darkened room Placing a cool cloth or ice pack on your forehead Drinking fluids
There are some lifestyle changes you can make to prevent migraines: Stress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and biofeedback, may reduce the number and severity of migraines. Biofeedback uses electronic devices to teach you to control certain body functions, such as your heartbeat, blood pressure, and muscle tension.
Make a log of what seems to trigger your migraines. You can learn what you need to avoid, such as certain foods and medicines. It also help you figure out what you should do, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and eating regular meals. Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle If you have obesity, losing weight may also be helpful
If you have frequent or severe migraines, you may need to take medicines to prevent further attacks. Talk with your health care provider about which drug would be right for you.
Certain natural treatments, such as riboflavin (vitamin B2) and coenzyme Q10, may help prevent migraines. If your magnesium level is low, you can try taking magnesium. There is also an herb, butterbur, which some people take to prevent migraines. But butterbur may not be safe for long-term use. Always check with your health care provider before taking any supplements.
